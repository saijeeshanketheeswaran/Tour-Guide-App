Travel Guide App

Description: 
This is a basic travel guide application that runs on desktop. In order to access the features of this app, you have to create an account if not created. This app shows descriptions and video tours on major cities around the world. It also has a location map for directions, tabs for restaurants, parks, hotels and shopping places.

Special instruction:
In order to run some of the feautres in the application, your internet should be on.

We could not implement the current location, so we could not generate the nearest restaurants, parks, hotels and shopping places. So we ended up putting common fast-food restaurant images that are found around the world and we did the same thing for parks, hotels and shopping places.
